## ReactJS Fundamentals - Thinking in React

The goal of this exercise is to learn how to think in React.

## Requirements
You need to be comfortable writing JavaScript (ES6: Module system, class syntax, destructuring assignment).
You need to have `node`and `npm`installed in your computer.

## Getting started:

`git clone git@github.com:leanjscom/thinking-in-react.git && cd thinking-in-react && npm install && npm start`

## Exercise

1- Refactor the “about” and “footer” sections by creating a stateless component for each. Make sure everything works.


2- Refactor the navbar by creating a stateless component and pass the dependencies via props. Make sure everything works.


3- Refactor the books section by creating a stateless component and pass the dependencies via props. Make sure everything works.


4- Is there any state in app that should be in the Books component?  Refactor <Books> books if appropriate. Should <Books> be a stateless component or a class now?


5- Break <Books> down into  <BookList> and <BookFilter>


6- What do you think it would make sense to componentize next? Are there any parts on that view that you can reuse? Try to explain to a mentor what you want to refactor before you code :)
